    <string name="developer_note">This app is a simple day counter to count the progress of elapsed days spent on preventing unhealthy habits. This app is built on the OpenGL 2.0 version so it is expected to be supported for many devices. The instruction for the app is simple, you first set up the date you have given up the habit, this can also be later changed from settings or optionally you reset the timer to the current date if you wish to start over. You can also reset the app from settings so it will treat you as a new user next time when you open the app. Hope you enjoy this simple app and helpful to take a break from unhealthy habits.
